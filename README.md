# Benchmarking-of-NCS-in-IoT-networks
This repository contains the code and the datasets used in the thesis "Benchmarking of Latency Estimation Approaches in IoT Networks." The Simulator directory contains the modified version of [NCSim](https://github.com/chenyang03/NCSim) written in MATLAB. The notebooks directory contains the Juypter notebooks for the Contour plots, Heatmaps, Round Trip Time (RTT) data analysis, and the RTT datasets. The fit-iot directory contains the Python scripts for collecting the RTT data from FIT IoT-LAB. The Python scripts use the EnOSLib library to create experiments on FIT IoT-LAB. A virtual environment is used to run the scripts in fit-iot directory. The details on how to set up the virtual environment are provided in the EnOSLib tutorials web page.
